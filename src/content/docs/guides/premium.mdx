## Character images

As a supporter, you can upload images to [your characters](/guides/character-creation). Just as there is no limit to the number of characters you can save, there is no limit to the number of images you can upload.

### Upload

```
/character image upload
```

Select the image you want to upload by tapping the icon or dragging the file into the text box.

<Picture
  src={imageUpload}
  alt="Upload an image for your character"
  width={imgWidth}
/>

**Supported formats:**

* PNG
* WebP
* JPEG

### View

```
/character images
```

Click the buttons to page between images.

<Picture
  src={imageView}
  alt="View your or other players' images with /character images"
  width={imgWidth}
/>

<Aside type="tip">
You can view other players' images with the optional `owner` parameter. Tired of other players messing up your selection? Hide the controls with the `controls` parameter.
</Aside>

### Manage

When viewing your own images, you may click the *Manage* button to enter management mode. From here, you can promote/demote images to move them to the beginning/end of your list. To delete an image, click the *Delete* button.

<Picture
  src={imageManage}
  alt="Manage your images through /character images"
  width={imgWidth}
/>

## Dropping premium

Should your premium membership lapse, you will retain all premium features for the current billing period. Any uploaded images will remain for a month longer, after which point they will be automatically deleted.
