## Traits

*Traits* are your characters' Attributes and Abilities (WoD) or Skills (CofD). If you use it to construct a dice pool, it is almost always a Trait. In addition to your core Attributes, Abilities, and Skills, you can create Custom Traits not found on the standard character sheet. These Traits can then be used in [rolls](/guides/rolls).

### Assign

<Code code="/traits assign traits:Foo=1; Bar=2; Baz=3" mark={highlights} />

Use this command to assign one or more Traits to a character. It follows the pattern, `NAME=VALUE`. To assign more than one, separate them with semicolons (`;`). Trait names can contain spaces but not numbers.

### View

```
/traits list
```

View all of a character's Traits. If any [Specialties](#specialties) are assigned, they are displayed as well.

### Remove

<Code code="/traits remove traits:Foo; Bar; Baz" mark={highlights} />

Delete one or more Traits from a character. As with [`/traits assign`](#assign), separate multiple Traits with semicolons (`;`).

## Specialties

Specialties are areas of expertise characters have in some of their [Traits](#traits). **Botch** allows Specialties on Attributes, Abilities, and Custom Traits. Per the ***Chronicles of Darkness*** rules, **Beat** allows them on Skills and Custom Traits only. Like Traits, Specialties can be used in [rolls](/guides/rolls).

### Assign

<Code code="/specialties assign specialties:Foo=Spec,Another Spec; Bar=Yet Another Spec" mark={highlights} />

Specialty assignment follows the form, `TRAIT=SPEC`. Specialty names can contain spaces, but not numbers. You may assign two or more Specialties at a time by separating them with commas (`,`). You may assign Specialties to multiple Traits by separating them with semicolons (`;`). Contrary to game rules as written, there are no limits to the number of specialties you can assign to a trait.

### View

See [`/traits list`](#view).

### Remove

<Code code="/specialties remove specialties:Foo=Spec,Another Spec; Bar=Yet Another Spec" mark={highlights} />

Specialty removal follows the form, `TRAIT=SPEC`. As with [`/specialties assign`](#assign-1), you may remove two or more Specialties at once by separating them with commas (`,`). You may remove Specialties from multiple Traits by separating them with semicolons (`;`).
