**Server admins** have the ability to perform actions/lookups on players' characters with the following commands:

* [`/roll`](/reference/rolls#roll): Perform a roll on a player's behalf.
* [`/character display`](/reference/characters#character-display): View a character's stats.
* [`/traits list`](/reference/traits#traits-list): View a character's Traits and Specialties.

To use these special lookups, first select the optional `owner` parameter, *then* the `character` parameter. Normal users attempting a lookup with one of these commands will see an error message.

<Aside>
  The order is important! Due to Discord caching, if you select `character` before `owner`, then you will only see your own characters
