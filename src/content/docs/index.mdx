## Character sheets that don't get coffee stains

Keep your [character details](/guides/character-creation) right in Discord! Now you can [stop abusing your Humanity track](/guides/character-management) with that eraser.

## Smart rolls for the supernaturally challenged

Your sheet's at your disposalâ€”use it! No more looking up your scores. [Just type your traits directly.](/guides/rolls)

* `/roll pool:Strength + Brawl` for when diplomacy means punching.
* `/roll pool:Manipulation + Subterfuge` when the Prince suspects it was you who streamed Elysium last night.
* `/roll pool:Composure + Occult` to not scream when the ancient tome starts bleeding.

## Macros for the perpetually impatient

[Create shortcuts](/guides/macros) for those rolls you make way too often:

* `/mroll macro:hunt` when you're feeling peckish.
* `/mroll macro:nightmares` after the night life has gotten to you.
* `/mroll macro:bluff` to convince your "friends" you definitely know what a smartphone is.

## Character images that look the part

Become a [Patreon supporter](https://patreon.com/tiltowait) and [upload pictures of your character](/guides/premium) looking as cool as you think you are. Perfect for flexing on that fledgling still in his *agoge*.

## More features added all the time!

Well, maybe not *all* the time. But the development pace feels downright brisk when you're an ancient immortal.
