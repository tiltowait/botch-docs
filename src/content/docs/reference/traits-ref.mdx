## About Traits

Traits are Attributes, Abilities, Skills, etc.â€”the things from which you construct 99% of your dice pools. Each [character](/guides/character-creation) has a number of predefined, or "Core", Traits. (Exactly what these Core Traits are defends on the system, but every character has, at a minimum, Attributes and Abilities/Skills.) In addition, both **Botch** and **Beat** allow you to supplement these Core Traits with Custom Traits. [Traits can be used in rolls.](/guides/rolls)

### `/traits assign`

This command assigns Traits and associated ratings ("dots") to a character. If the Trait doesn't exist, it will be created; otherwise, its value will simply be updated.

| Parameter   | Description                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **traits**  | The Traits to assign.                                     |
| *character* | The character receiving the Traits.                       |

#### The assignment syntax

Traits are assigned with a syntax of `Trait=Rating`. You can assign multiple Traits at a time by separating them with semicolons (`;`): `Foo=2; Bar=4; Baz=1`, and so on.

Trait names can contain spaces and underscores.

### `/traits list`

View a list of all Traits and [Specialties](/reference/specialties) assigned to a character.

| Parameter   | Description                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| *character* | The character to view.                                    |

### `/traits remove`

Remove Traits from a character. Core Traits are reset to 0 rather than removed completely.

| Parameter   | Description                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **traits**  | The Traits to remove.                                     |
| *character* | The character losing the Traits.                          |

### The removal syntax

Separate Trait names with semicolons (`;`). Example: `Foo; Bar; Baz`.
