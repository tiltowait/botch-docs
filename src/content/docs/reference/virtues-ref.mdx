<Aside>As Virtues are found in *World of Darkness*, not *Chronicles of Darkness*, this section applies to **Beat** only. Required parameters are in **bold**; [optional parameters](/reference/optional-parameters) are in *italics*.</Aside>

Virtues are similar to Traits, with the following differences:

* You must have exactly three of them
* You must always have Courage
* You must choose between Conscience/Conviction and SelfControl/Instinct.

### `/virtues set`

Though they appear when using [`/traits list`](/reference/traits/#traits-list), Virtues can only be set/updated with `/virtues set`.

  | Parameter       | Description                  |
  |-----------------|------------------------------|
  | **virtue**      | The Virtue to set or update. |
  | **rating**      | The rating to give it.       |
  | *character*     | The character to adjust.     |

  When choosing a `virtue` the character doesn't possess, the matching Virtue will be replaced. In other words, selecting "Conviction" for a character currently possessing Conscience will replace one with the other. The same is true for SelfControl and Instinct. There is no reciprocal for Courage.

  ***Note:** Due to engine limitations, "Self-Control" is "SelfControl".*
