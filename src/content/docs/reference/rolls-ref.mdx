## About rolls

Even more than [character management](/guides/character-creation), rolls are the primary purpose behind **Botch** and **Beat**. When you make a [roll](/guide/rolls), you can use your characters' [Traits and Specialties](/guides/traits) or simply use raw numbers. In other words, you don't *need* a character to use the bot, though you will be missing out on its best functionality.

### `/roll`

The most important command, this is what you will use 90% of the time you invoke the bot.

<Aside>
  The `specialty` option is primarily intended for making rolls without a character. When using a character, it is best to use the `Trait.Specialty` syntax (below).
</Aside>

#### The `pool` syntax

**Recommended reading:** <LinkButton href="/guides/rolls">Rolls Guide</LinkButton>

A roll's `pool` can be a number ("2"), an equation of numbers ("2+3-1") (plus/minus only), or an equation of [Traits and Specialties](/guides/traits). Traits and Specialties require a [character](/guides/character-creation) to use.

To roll with Traits, simply type their names in the `pool`, e.g. "Strength+Brawl". [Specialties](/reference/specialties) are specified with dot-syntax (`.`): "Strength+Brawl.Grappling".

<Aside type="tip">
  You don't have to type full Trait names! [Read about Shortcuts here.](/guides/rolls#shortcuts)
</Aside>

### `/chance` (CofD only)

Roll a Chance die. A 10 succeeds. A 1 is a critical failure. Everything else is a simple failure.
