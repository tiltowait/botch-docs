Miscellaneous commands that don't fit other sections.

### `/botches` (WoD only)

See how many botches you've rolled on the server :)

### `/changelog`

Display the latest release notes.

| Parameter | Description                                                 |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| *hidden*  | Whether to hide the changelog from others (default `true`). |

### `/coin`

Flip a coin (heads or tails).

### `/info`

Show bot info. **Note:** If the build version is `local`, then the build is outside of a standard release cycle, and `/changelog` may be inaccurate. Usually, a local build will have features/fixes beyond the posted changelog, not regressions.

### `/random`

Roll a random number.

| Parameter | Description                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **lower** | The lowest number that can be rolled (inclusive).  |
| **upper** | The highest number that can be rolled (inclusive). |

Hopefully it goes without saying, but `lower` must be lower than `upper`.
