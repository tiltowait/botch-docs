## About Specialties

Specialties represent expertise in certain [Traits](/reference/traits). When used in [rolls](/guides/rolls), they apply a bonus depending on the system:

* **World of Darkness:** Rolled 10s grant two successes each
* **Chronicles of Darkness:** Add one bonus die.

### `/specialties assign`

This command assigns Specialties to one or more Traits. If the Trait doesn't exist, the bot will throw an error.

| Parameter        | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **specialties**  | The Specialties to assign.                                |
| *character*      | The character receiving the Specialties.                  |

#### The assignment syntax

Specialties are assigned with a syntax of `Trait=Specialty`. You can assign multiple Specialties at a time by separating them with commas (`,`): `Foo=Bar,Baz`, and so on. You can assign Specialties to multiple Traits in a single invocation by separating each Trait/Specialty clause with a semicolon (`;`): `Foo=Bar; Baz=Qux`.

Specialty names can contain spaces and underscores.

### Viewing Specialties

| Parameter        | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **specialties**  | The Specialties to remove.                                |
| *character*      | The character losing the Specialties.                     |
