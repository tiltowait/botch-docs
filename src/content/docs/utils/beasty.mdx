In Discord play-by-post, many servers use *italic text* to indicate internal thoughts and **bold text** for thoughts that are dominated by the Beast.

**Beasty** lets you add a little flair by "interleaving" character thoughts with "Beast thoughts". The output switches between regular italics and bold italics to indicate the character's thoughts are in line with their Beast's.
Just click copy and paste it into the chat!
